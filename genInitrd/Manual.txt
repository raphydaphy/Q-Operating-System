Welcome to the Q Operating System created by hobbists around the world hosted on github!

The goal of this operating system is to make it a versatile.

If enter key does not work, it might mean that the input is too long...
Also if the delete key does not work, it means you are trying to delete the prompt...

If you need this file, type cat, and then Manual.txt!

Here are some commands to start you off:
writer  -> A simplistic note taker
clear   -> Clears the current screen
execute -> Runs code with specified type
skip    -> Does nothing (hence the name)
files   -> List the files and directories
cat     -> Prints the file to the console
system  -> Advance system option
    Arguments:
    shutdown    -> shutdown system
    reboot      -> reboot system
    halt        -> halt system operation
hi      -> The computer greets you back
calc    -> Its a calculator
    -h          -> show calculator help (needs updating)

What about keybindings?
Ctrl-b  -> Cursor to left
Ctrl-f  -> Cursor to right
Ctrl-a  -> Cursor to beginning of line
Ctrl-p  -> Cursor move up
Ctrl-n  -> Cursor move down
Ctrl-z  -> Quit (for writer)
Ctrl-l  -> Clears screen
